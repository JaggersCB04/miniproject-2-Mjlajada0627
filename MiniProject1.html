My favorite class is 7th hour because all of my friends are in that class and we can talk while we do work. I like 7th hour
because my teacher lets us talk most of the time and he makes learning fun and easy. 7th hour is fun and sometimes people 
in that class make you laugh. My 7th hour teacher is usually ok with us talking with our friends and we can eat food if we 
ask for permission.
